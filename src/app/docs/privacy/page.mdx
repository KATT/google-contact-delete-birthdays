# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 5th of August 2025

## Introduction

Welcome to our Contacts application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how we handle your information. This privacy policy explains our data practices and your rights.

## Our Data Philosophy

We believe in minimal data collection and maximum privacy protection. Our application is designed with privacy-first principles:

- **No Data Storage**: We do not store any of your personal information, contacts, or data on our servers
- **Immediate Disconnection**: When you log out, we immediately revoke all connections and access to your data
- **Temporary Access Only**: We only access your data temporarily while you are actively using the application

## Information We Access (But Don't Store)

When you use our application, we may temporarily access:

- **Contact Information**: Your Google contacts (name, email, phone numbers, birthdays)
- **Account Information**: Basic Google account details for authentication

**Important**: We do not store, save, or retain any of this information on our servers. All data access is temporary and ceases immediately when you log out.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information solely to:

- Authenticate your identity through Google
- Display your contacts within the application
- Provide the core functionality of our contacts management service

We do not:

- Store your contacts or personal information
- Share your contact data with third parties
- Use your contact information for marketing purposes
- Track your usage patterns beyond basic analytics

## Data Security

- All connections to Google are encrypted using industry-standard protocols
- We use secure authentication methods (OAuth 2.0)
- Authentication tokens are stored securely in HTTP-only cookies for up to 7 days
- No contact data is transmitted or stored insecurely
- Access is immediately revoked upon logout

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Immediate Data Deletion**: Your data is never stored, so there's nothing to delete
- **Access Control**: You control access through your Google account settings
- **Revoke Access**: You can revoke our application's access to your Google account at any time
- **Logout**: Simply logging out immediately terminates all data access and revokes our app's access to your Google account

## Third-Party Services

We use Google's OAuth service for authentication and Google Analytics for usage analytics. Google's privacy policy applies to the authentication process. We do not have access to your Google account beyond what you explicitly authorize.

### Analytics

We use Google Analytics to understand how our application is used. This helps us improve the user experience. Analytics data is collected anonymously and does not include any personal contact information.

## Children's Privacy

Our application is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect or process information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new policy on this page.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our data practices, please contact us through the application.

## Your Privacy Matters

We are committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining the highest standards of data protection. Our no-storage approach ensures that your personal information remains under your control at all times.
